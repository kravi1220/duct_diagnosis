# duct_diagnosis

The Python function computes subsurface acoustic duct properties in the ocean, within a depth range of 10 m to 500 m, using input variables: sound speed (m/s), temperature (degrees Celsius), salinity (psu), zonal velocity (u-velocity, m/s), meridional velocity (v-velocity, m/s), and depth (m). This function analyzes the sound speed profile to identify subsurface duct conditions that affect underwater subsurface sound propagation. The function returns duct properties, including duct depth, thickness, strength, temperature,salinity,u and v at duct axis.
